    PEP8 cleanup of all lines > 80 chars
    Rename of classes/variables for space/consistency

    Fix for applet/font-sizing when changing orientation
    Changed instantiation of color objects to use gtk.gdk.color_parse instead of gtk.gdk.Color('#XXX') for older systems

12/20/2009:
    Change logic to graph calculation which corrects the following rendering issues -
        Graph lines drawing outside of border/frame
        Graph normalized top-value was rendering off-screen when applet size smaller than 35
        Graph normalized top-value was rendering very low on the graph when applet size greater than 60
    Changed scaling of initial icon - it was rendering too large and centered text was displayed with an odd alignment to the dock
    Fixed some issues with default values
    Changed short-name to 'bandwidth-monitor' to match schema file
    Corrected path to UI file
    Fixed division by zero error
    Addedd bandwidth-monitor.ui and bwmprefs.py to Makefile.am

12/19/2009:
    Added preferences to control -
        Enable/Disable drawing of the background
        Enable/Disable drawing of the border
        Select color/opacity of background
        Select color/opacity of border
        Options to control the text representation of throughput
            Display Upload/Download text
            Display Sum text only
            Do not display text - only draw the graph.
        Enable/Disable drawing the zero value in the graph (if true, draw a line at the bottom of the graph for zero value)

12/18/2009:
    Cleaned up code to make it run faster or use less resources
    Removed everything related to the status of interfaces (Not required, may add later)

12/14/2009:
    Created preferences dialog to manage options -
        An option to select the unit Bytes/bits
        A spinbutton entry for setting the minimum threshold
        A "Devices" pref-pane which allows selection of interfaces into virtual interfaces
        A color picker for upload and download colors for use in the line-graph.
    Fixed division by zero that would occur in some scenarios.

12/10/2009:
    Added virtual interfaces for SUM and MULTI
        The Sum Interface is a virtual interface which displays the sum throughput of all interfaces that are selected for "Sum"
        The Multi Interface is a virtual interface which displays each individual throughput of the interfaces that are selected for "Multi", each with the colors defined for the interface.
    Added logic to parse and use preferences that are planned
