Mono-test - An experimental C# applet

Compiling:
----------

Since the build system doesn't support Mono applets atm, you need to compile
the applet by hand and copy the resulting .exe file to appropriate location.
(of course you'll also need to put the desktop file somewhere...)

For Ubuntu 9.04 you can compile the applet like this:

gmcs -out:mono-test.exe \
     -pkg:libawn-sharp \
     -r:/usr/lib/mono/2.0/Mono.GetOptions.dll \
     Applet.cs

You'll need the libmono-getoptions2.0-cil package for Mono.GetOptions.dll
(but you can also use the *1.0-cil version).
Also if you don't have libawn-sharp installed you can substitute
the "-pkg:libawn-sharp" with "-r:/path/to/libawn-sharp.dll".
