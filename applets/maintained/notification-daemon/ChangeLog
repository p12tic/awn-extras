==================== 0.3.7 ====================

Tue Feb 27 23:19:00 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* NEWS:
	  - Bump to version 0.3.7.

Tue Feb 27 23:15:53 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in:
	  - We don't actually bundle the capplet yet, so don't include it in
	    POTFILES.in. This fixes make distcheck.

Thu Feb 15 03:05:49 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon/stack.c:
	* NEWS:
	  - Fix a memory leak when removing a notification from the stack.
	    Patch by Sven Wegener. This closes bug #105.

Thu Feb 15 02:52:02 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* po/ChangeLog:
	A po/sv.po:
	* AUTHORS:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Added a Swedish translation from Daniel Nylander. Closes ticket #99.

Sat Jan 13 01:20:23 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Added a work in progress gradient-happy mode that must be enabled by
	    defining ENABLE_GRADIENT_LOOK in theme.c.

Sat Jan 13 00:18:40 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Adjust the opacity of the notification just ever so slightly. I think
	    this makes the notification more readable (less content behind it
	    leaking through) while still looking nice and transparent. I might be
	    full of it.

Fri Jan 12 23:57:15 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Added support for a semi-transparent background in the notification
	    window on the standard theme on GTK+ 2.10 when a compositing manager
	    is active. Patch by Matt Walton. Closes ticket #110.

Fri Jan 12 23:06:15 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Don't return when painting the window if we don't have a width set,
	    waiting for configure. This sometimes ends up with the
	    context-sensitive notifications appearing in 0, 0. Instead, just grab
	    the allocation width and height. It all feels hacky, but this seems to
	    at least work.

Wed Jan 10 15:43:12 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - We were trying to compute a border in expose_event, which sometimes
	    was called before configure_event. configure_event sets stuff that
	    our border computerator needed, so it blew up or screwed up. We now
	    wait for the configure_event before even trying it, and
	    the configure_event handler now ensures that we get an expose_event.

Wed Jan 10 15:05:28 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Fix a crash when displaying notifications with arrows. I can't believe
	    I didn't catch this before. There's still a bug though where you can't
	    display a notification with arrows while a normal notification is on
	    the screen, but I have no clue why.

Fri Jan 05 15:06:51 PST 2007  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* po/ChangeLog:
	A po/de.po:
	* AUTHORS:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Added the German translation from Florian Steinel. This closes
	    ticket #106.

Tue Nov 14 00:09:41 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Fix some odd little graphics drawing bugs by drawing onto the main
	    vbox and sticking an eventbox between the window and that. This fixes
	    the weird problems that shouldn't exist in the first place by using,
	    I don't know, magic or something.

Mon Nov 13 23:31:07 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon/stack.c:
	  - Fix a bug I introduced where we were getting the size request of the
	    window being added/removed, instead of the current one being iterated
	    over. This was causing massive ugliness of the fourth kind.

Mon Nov 13 22:47:42 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Make sure the default width is actually set on the notification.
	  - Increase the default width to 400px.

Mon Nov 13 21:48:11 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon/stack.c:
	  - Condense a lot of duplicate logic from notify_stack_add_window() and
	    notify_stack_remove_window() into notify_stack_shift_notifications().

Mon Nov 13 00:49:42 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Fix fill_background() to use the allocated width and height, rather
	    than the stored width and height. This fixes a problem where the
	    widget was being painted grey.
	  - Use fill_background() for both the window and the pie progress thing.

Thu Nov 09 18:03:31 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Update the top and bottom spacers outside of the window painting code,
	    as that ended up unsurprisingly causing graphical glitches. We now
	    update it when moving/resizing the window or setting the arrow info.

Thu Nov 09 17:45:01 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Instead of checking if the shape points array is NULL, just assert
	    that it isn't. It should never be.

Thu Nov 09 16:49:39 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Split the background filling and stripe painting out of draw_border().
	    Put the calls into paint_window() and connect that to the expose
	    event.

Thu Nov 09 16:42:58 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Fix a crash caused by destroying an already freed array of points
	    during the destruction of windows with arrows.

Thu Nov 09 16:35:34 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	* NEWS:
	  - Clicking anywhere in a notification should now close the notification.
	    This was happening only on the body text sometimes.

Thu Nov 09 16:34:03 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Clean up a little bit more code. Free the array of shape points
	    earlier.

Sun Nov 05 23:56:43 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Fix several rendering glitches with the borders in the standard theme.
	    There's a couple bugs left, but they're less glaring. Also, cleaned up
	    some of the code a bit.

Sun Nov 05 16:33:36 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Make the standard notification theme (mostly) accessible to screen
	    readers. This could stand some improvement.

Sun Nov 05 12:18:00 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* configure.ac:
	  - Patch by compnerd to drop the check for popt during configure, as we
	    no longer use it. This closes bug #88.

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Patch by Nick Schermer to fix a memory leak. We lost 4 bytes for
	    every notification displayed with the standard theme.

Sun Jul 30 15:32:10 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:

	    enum values for stack locations.

Sat Jul 29 21:00:45 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:

Sat Jul 29 19:19:34 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Typedef the popup location type enum so that we can refer to it as a
	    name, rather than assigning the values to a gchar.
	  - Fix a memory leak when retrieving the stack location pref string.

Sat Jul 29 15:35:44 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* data/notification-daemon.schemas.in:
	  - Fix a typo for the default value for stack location. It should have
	    been "bottom_right," not "right_bottom." Closes ticket #57.

Sat Jul 29 03:46:43 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* data/notification-daemon.schemas.in:
	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/daemon.h:
	* src/engines.c:
	  - Patch by M.S. to support custom corner stacking positions through a
	    gconf key. Now users can specify that their notifications should
	    originate from any corner they choose. This closes ticket #57.

Sat Jul 29 03:11:15 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Patch by Ed Catmur to handle the case where a replaces_id of a
	    non-existant notification was set. Under this case, we now generate a
	    new ID and send it back in the notification, rather than creating a
	    broken notification. This closes ticket #76.

Sat Jul 29 02:43:25 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:

	    themes. This closes ticket #61.

Wed Jul 12 03:27:39 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* NEWS:
	  - A notification's timeout will now pause while the mouse is hovering
	    over the notification. This allows users to respond to notifications
	    without it suddenly disappearing before the user clicks.
	    This closes ticket #73.

Sun Apr 23 15:48:14 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Use cairo to render the countdown timer if using gtk 2.8.0+. This
	    makes the countdown timer all antialiased and pretty.

Fri Apr 21 17:17:40 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Fix the scaling of different icon sizes. I was using a MAX when
	    I should have used a MIN. Now small icons display as small, and
	    larger icons are scaled down to 48x48.

Fri Apr 21 16:42:46 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Patch by M.S. to fix the problem where icons were being clipped in
	    notifications if the text didn't wrap enough lines. This fixes
	    bug #21.

Fri Apr 21 16:33:56 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Fix notifications no longer expiring due to the fix for bug #22.
	    The logic is now a bit smarter and more hacky. But it works. And
	    really, if it didn't, would I be committing this? Yes, probably.

Fri Apr 21 15:54:01 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	    theme).
	  - Disabled the Bubble theme for this release. It's the source of too
	    many bugs.

Tue Apr 11 22:54:13 PDT 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	  - Change the stripe width to 30. Images align a lot nicer now.

Sat Feb 04 12:38:22 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Use the theme colors to draw the low and normal urgency stripes.
	    Low is the style's nomral BG state. Normal is the selected state.
	    Critical is custom. We hard-code it red. Eventually, I'd like all
	    this to change when the themeable gtk colors are supported.

Sat Feb 04 12:28:24 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:

	    simply expires.

Sat Feb 04 02:04:35 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:

Sat Feb 04 01:48:50 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Check notification expiration every 100ms instead of every 500ms.

Sat Feb 04 01:26:41 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Use the action key to look up an icon theme stock icon. If one
	    exists, display it next to the name.

Sat Feb 04 01:07:02 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Change the actions to use right-aligned small text buttons. This
	    makes it a bit more clear as to what these really are.

Sat Feb 04 00:54:34 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Hide the content box containing the body, actions and icon when
	    all of those are invisible (unset). This allows the whole
	    notification to be very short when there's just a summary, instead
	    of having useless, ugly extra vertical whitespace.

Sat Feb 04 00:37:55 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/bgbox.c:
	* themes/standard/bgbox.h:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Make some changes to the Standard theme in order to bring it a
	    bit closer to the style used in the December GNOME mockups. The
	    mockups had some nice stylistic and usability ideas that were
	    worth looking into.

Wed Feb 01 19:17:09 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/bubble/Makefile.am:
	* themes/standard/Makefile.am:
	  - Patch by Rodney Dawes to install the theme engines as unversioned
	    libraries instead of versioned libraries.

Sun Jan 29 13:03:09 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/engines.c:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Patch by Michael Vogt and modified a bit by me to add a close
	    button to notifications. This is similar to the one used in Ubuntu
	    Dapper, with a small placement change and functionality change: the
	    notification no longer emits the ActionInvoked for the default action
	    when closed. This closes ticket #8.
	  - Moved data freeing for the standard theme and for theme engine
	    unreffing out of the close functions and into a callback specified
	    through g_object_set_data_full().
	  - The daemon now listens for when notification windows are destroyed,
	    and reacts appropriately, instead of crashing.

Sun Jan 29 12:12:43 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* configure.ac:
	  - Fix a couple missing commas in the list of package modules. Also
	    take the time to clean this up a bit and put each module on its own
	    line, and put the required versions into their own variables.
	  - Bump the version to 0.3.3.90.

==================== 0.3.3 ====================

Wed Jan 25 00:29:59 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* ChangeLog:
	* NEWS:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Bump the version to 0.3.3. Prepare for release.

Wed Jan 25 00:21:49 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - When using icontheme icons, use the size closest to 48x48. However,
	    if the closest image is smaller, use the small image instead of
	    scaling up. If it's bigger, scale down to 48x48.

Wed Jan 25 00:01:56 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Don't pop up a notification if a window is full screen or if the
	    screensaver is active. This closes bug #4.

Tue Jan 24 00:18:18 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	* themes/bubble/Makefile.am:
	* themes/standard/Makefile.am:
	* NEWS:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Install and check for engines in
	    $(libdir)/notification-daemon-1.0/engines, as opposed to
	    $(libdir)/notification-daemon/engines. This fixes bug #3.

==================== 0.3.2 ====================

Mon Jan 23 00:39:34 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - We support v0.9 of the Desktop Notifications spec. Make sure we
	    return that in GetServerInformation.

Mon Jan 23 00:38:18 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* NEWS:
	  - Add release news and bump the version up to 0.3.2.

Mon Jan 23 00:33:31 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/notificationdaemon.xml:
	  - Get rid of the GetServerInfo function. I thought I added this for
	    backward-compatibility, but I was wrong -- everyone was really using
	    the correct function.

Mon Jan 23 00:27:53 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* data/Makefile.am:
	A po/ChangeLog:
	* src/Makefile.am:

Sun Jan 22 23:54:53 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Add back working support for default actions. These were being
	    displayed as standard actions. Now they're once again emitted when
	    the notification is clicked.

Sun Jan 22 23:51:17 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* data/Makefile.am:

Sun Jan 22 23:38:31 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Fix several bugs (placement and possible crashers) in notification
	    replacement.

Sun Jan 22 23:31:36 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Hook the actions back up again. Switching to the BgBox widget broke
	    this.

Sun Jan 22 23:02:37 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Remove now dead code.

Sun Jan 22 22:28:39 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Draw the border of the notification window correctly under all tested
	    cases.

Sun Jan 22 20:02:58 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - The arrow will now point down if there's not enough room for it
	    to point up (such as if an icon on the bottom panel is the source for
	    the arrow).

Sun Jan 22 18:59:57 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Be super cool when it comes to arrow placement near the left and right
	    of the screen. The next couple of changes will add to the super
	    coolness of all of this.

Sun Jan 22 15:13:08 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/Makefile.am:
	A themes/standard/bgbox.c:
	A themes/standard/bgbox.h:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Added a BgBox widget to the standard theme. This is based off of
	    libview's BaseBGBox widget. It's being used for the themeing of the
	    standard theme, instead of hard-coding white.

Sun Jan 22 13:27:29 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* themes/bubble/eggnotificationbubblewidget.c:
	* themes/bubble/eggnotificationbubblewidget.h:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	* autogen.sh:
	  - Patch by Rodney Dawes to fix a problem with keeping a pointer to
	    the hints table in the themes. We no longer store the whole table,
	    but rather only the parts of it we care about. This fixes a crash.
	  - This patch also updates the required automake version to 1.9, to
	    be compatible with the new intltool and to use a more recent
	    gnome-common.

Sun Jan 22 13:23:51 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/daemon.h:
	* src/notificationdaemon.xml:
	  - Rearrange some parameters to match the spec.

Fri Jan 20 00:22:38 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Respect the user's work area (the area inside the panels and stuff)
	    when displaying notifications.

Fri Jan 20 00:15:04 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Small code cleanups.

Fri Jan 20 00:09:12 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Add a little hack to prevent the notification from closing when a
	    link is clicked.

Fri Jan 20 00:01:04 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Remove the debug messages. We shouldn't need these anymore, as the
	    base stuff is working.

Thu Jan 19 23:59:42 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/engines.c:
	* src/engines.h:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Add proper support for actions.
	  - Remove the action_invoked parameter to create_notification(), since
	    we're already passing it to add_notification_action.

Thu Jan 19 23:44:31 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/engines.c:
	* src/engines.h:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Pass a couple of callbacks to the theme engine's
	    create_notification() function: action_invoked and url_clicked.
	  - Move the URL clicking callback to daemon.c from the standard engine.
	    The standard engine now calls the passed url_clicked function.

Thu Jan 19 23:33:46 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Sexy new separator. Well, it's better than "|" anyway.

Thu Jan 19 23:23:55 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Add the beginnings of action support.

Thu Jan 19 22:34:16 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* data/Makefile.am:
	  - NO! Install the schema always!

Thu Jan 19 10:18:09 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Simplify a small piece of logic.

Thu Jan 19 02:37:31 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/daemon.h:
	* src/engines.c:
	  - Reorganize the code styles to match the style of the rest of Galago
	    and of the previous libnotify.

Thu Jan 19 01:36:16 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Add back support for hyperlinks in the standard engine.

	* src/daemon.c:
	* src/daemon.h:
	* src/notificationdaemon.xml:
	  - Add back GetCapabilities and GetServerInformation.

	  - Added GConf support. The theme can now be set through gconf-editor.

Sun Jan 15 14:49:49 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/engines.c:
	* src/engines.h:
	  - Save the engine used in the resulting notification window's
	    object data. Use that engine for all future operations on that
	    notification.
	  - Handle ref counting on notification engines so that they'll be
	    properly when the time comes. As of right now, this won't happen.

Fri Jan 13 11:44:00 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/bubble/eggnotificationbubblewidget.c:
	* themes/bubble/eggnotificationbubblewidget.h:
	* themes/bubble/theme.c:
	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Patch by Rodney Dawes to add support for passing hints to the
	    notification engines. This will allow engines to theme based on
	    urgency levels and other such data.

Thu Jan 12 11:06:27 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/daemon.c:
	  - Listen to the button-release-event signal instead of "clicked" for
	    notifications.

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Another shot at setting the window shape every time. I've read that
	    there's some gtk 2.8 bug regarding this. Anyhow, in order to
	    guarantee it, I'm always setting the shape in the expose handler.
	    Even doing it only once or twice in the expose handler causes issues,
	    but setting it every time works. We need a better way...

Thu Jan 12 00:57:22 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* themes/standard/theme.c:
	  - Make sure we shape the window correctly every time we generate the
	    arrow so that we don't leave artifacts.

Thu Jan 12 00:10:18 PST 2006  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* src/engines.c:
	A themes/standard/Makefile.am:
	A themes/standard/theme.c:
	* themes/Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Add the beginnings of the "standard" theme. This is now the default.
	    It's not complete. Many things are still missing. Theme selection
	    will be added later.

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	  - Big change. We're moving to a theme engine model for displaying
	    notifications. This is something I've wanted for a long time. For now,
	    the "bubble" theme, as I call it (which we can definitely change) is
	    the default. We'll make modules configurable by the theme and/or by
	    the user later. Make sure you do a make install in themes!

	  - Rename from notify-daemon to notification-daemon. I've received a
	    number of questions and some complaints about the name change,
	    some of which are packaging concerns, some upgrade concerns, and
	    just general confusion and "Why?" As this is the "Desktop
	    Notifications" project, and due to reasons expressed to me from
	    others, I feel it's best to revert the name.

	* src/eggnotificationbubblewidget.c:
	* src/notifydaemon.c:
